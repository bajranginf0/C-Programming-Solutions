1) write a c program to swap two numbers using third variable the given numbers are a=13 , b=15 and expected output is b=13 and a=15?
ans) c=a;
a=b;
b=c;

2) write a c program to swap two numbers without using third varible?
ans) a=a+b;
b=a-b;
a=a-b;

3) to add two integers without using + operator?
ans- a-(-b)

4) to find the next multiple of 100 of a given number 245 and expected output is 300?
ans)nextmultipleof100 = (number= 245+99)/100*100)
