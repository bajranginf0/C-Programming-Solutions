# üöÄ C Programming Solutions

Welcome to my **C Programming** repository! This repo contains solutions to various C programming problems I previously solved on **CodeHS**. These solutions cover a wide range of topics, from basic syntax to advanced concepts.

## üèÜ **My Coding Journey**
During my time at **Naresh i Technologies**, I actively practiced C programming on **CodeHS**, solving **5 to 8 problems daily**. Although my streaks were not maintained due to platform scheduling, I consistently worked on **strengthening my problem-solving skills** and building a strong foundation in C.
